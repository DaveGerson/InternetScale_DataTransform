===========================

This code repo outlines the steps that were used to pre-process the data for use in the Kaggle Datamining Challenge. 

The two files contained here are the pig script which was used to parse tha data into logical, right sized summary's for data analysis.  The HQl file is a HIve flavor SQL query whihc recreates some of the features used in the pig booklet.  It also includes some new advanced functions that became available in the most recent release of hive.  

Future plans for this book will be to utilize the data-fu package sampling function in order to properly create test, development, and evaluation data samples.
